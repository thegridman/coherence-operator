# -------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the Cluster Roles required by the Coherence Operator
# to self-manage its CRDs and Web-Hooks.
#
# The Operator no longer installs its own CRDs so this role
# is now only used by the operator to ensure any existing
# webhook config gets removed when the operator starts.
#
# If the operator has never been installed with web hooks
# enabled, or the web hook config has been manually removed,
# then this role is not required.
